This is a Deno template to use it with Kaboom. May have bugs, in testing phase.

If you want use js instead ts you can change the extension of code/main.ts to .js and change entrypoints
in `run.ts` change the extension too!

## Scripts
This template uses [Velociraptor](https://velociraptor.run) to manage console scripts. Install it to use the commands:

`vr run` - run project

- amyspark-ng
Kaboom template made with deno that edited to my personal needs and current knowledge, very cool.

- To create new project, do `git clone https://github.com/amyspark-ng/kaboomdeno-template`
`vr start` - run project (wth???)
